# HR Data Optimization & Visualization

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on optimizing and visualizing HR data by normalizing the dataset, performing ETL processes, and building interactive Tableau dashboards. The goal was to enhance data integrity, reduce redundancy, and provide actionable insights for HR decision-making.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Data Preparation**: Tableau Prep  
- **Database Integration**: SQL (1NF → 3NF normalization)  
- **Visualization**: Tableau Desktop  
- **Other Skills**: Data normalization, ETL, calculated fields, filters, action filters  

## 🔍 Approach
1. **Data Normalization**
   - Converted HR dataset through 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.
   - Improved data integrity and eliminated redundancy.
   - Prepared dataset for seamless SQL integration.

2. **ETL Process**
   - Built a complete ETL pipeline in Tableau Prep.
   - Extracted, transformed, and loaded cleaned HR data into Tableau.

3. **Dashboard Design**
   - Developed 3+ interactive visualizations: Pie Charts, Bar Graphs, Tables, Treemaps.
   - Created **calculated fields** (e.g., Employee Age from DOB, Employment Duration from Hire/Termination dates).
   - Applied **filters** (e.g., DeptID, Position).
   - Enabled **action filters** so selecting one graph (e.g., Production dept in Pie Chart) updates other visualizations (bar graph, table, treemap).

4. **Formatting**
   - Added labels and captions for clarity.
   - Improved layout for professional presentation.

## 📊 Key Insights
- Dynamic filtering allows HR managers to drill down by department or position.
- Calculated fields provided new KPIs such as **average tenure** and **workforce age distribution**.
- Dashboards significantly improved **reporting efficiency** and **decision-making speed**.

## 🚀 Results
- Delivered a unified HR dashboard with **real-time filtering and insights**.  
- Enhanced HR’s ability to monitor workforce distribution, attrition, and departmental trends.  
- Increased efficiency in HR reporting workflows.
